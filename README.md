mdk - a colour theme for GVim
===

This is a gratuitous, hacked together colour theme for GVim.

Colours
-------

Literals are all red/white (ie basically pink) based. Literals that can have interpolation or escapes are backgrounded pink for the 'literal' portion. Numbers are pink foreground, with slight variations in colour.

Delimeters are foregrounded differently to the literal they enclose.

Docstrings are halfway between comments and literal strings, so they are orangey-yellow.
